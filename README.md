# NASCAR Driver Winnings Regression Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores which **performance factors** most strongly influence **NASCAR driver earnings**. Using 2011 NASCAR performance data, I built a multiple linear regression model to predict driver winnings and visualized insights in Tableau.

## Goals
- Identify which performance metrics best predict driver earnings.
- Build a **multiple regression model** to estimate earnings.
- Create **easy-to-understand visualizations** to support team and business decision-making.

## Tools Used
- **Excel** â€” for regression modeling and variable engineering.
- **Tableau** â€” for interactive dashboards and data visualization.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaned and formatted 2011 NASCAR data.
   - Engineered new features: _Top 2â€“5 Finishes_ and _Top 6â€“10 Finishes_.
2. **Regression Modeling**
   - Built a multiple linear regression model in Excel.
   - Evaluated statistical significance and adjusted variables for model clarity.
3. **Insights**
   - Found that _Top 10 finishes_ and _Wins_ were the strongest predictors of earnings.
   - Visualized trends to help stakeholders understand driver performance and earnings patterns.

## Example Visuals
*(Add screenshots of your Tableau dashboard or key charts here â€” you can upload images to your repo and link them.)*

## ðŸš€ Key Takeaways
- Data-driven models can identify meaningful patterns in performance-based compensation.
- Feature engineering improved model accuracy and interpretability.
- Visualization made complex regression results accessible to non-technical audiences.
